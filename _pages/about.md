I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [University of Nebraska–Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu/), starting from the 2025 Summer term.  
My research interests lie in **time-sensitive (event-driven) networking**, **digital radio twins**, and **machine learning for wireless and edge systems**. I am particularly interested in building data-driven, physically grounded models that bridge theory and real-world deployments.

I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Qiang Liu](https://liuqiang12040913.github.io/). Together, we work on leveraging digital twins, optimization, and learning-based methods to improve the reliability, efficiency, and intelligence of next-generation communication networks.

From June 2023 to April 2025, I worked as a Research Assistant at [The Future Laboratory, Tsinghua University](https://thfl.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), where I was involved in interdisciplinary projects connecting wireless communication, sensing, and intelligent applications.
